# Multivariate interrupted timeseries analysis of COVID-19 on the Austrlian cattle market 
The following analysis has been inspired by a github issue found on the [CausalPy Github page](https://github.com/pymc-labs/CausalPy/issues/357), Briefly the issue is about the implenation of Mulivariate Interupted timeseries modelling capabuiltiy to the package. Firstly, this would be a great addition to a great package. 

However, the issue for me a rose due to the reponses from unamed indivudals that such models would solve real analysis problems they were facing in their work. My issue with this is simple why dont they just implement the model themselves within using any of the brillant problasbliotc programming langauges that exist and do their analysis. I would like to make the aruement that this is an example of a first world modelling problem.
