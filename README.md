# Multivariate interrupted timeseries analysis of COVID-19 on the Austrlian cattle market 
The following analysis has been inspired by a github issue found on the [CausalPy Github page](https://github.com/pymc-labs/CausalPy/issues/357), Briefly the issue is about the implenation of Mulivariate Interupted timeseries modelling capabilty to the package. Firstly, this would be a great addition to a great package. 

However, the issue for me arose due to the reponses from individuals that such models would solve real analysis problems they were facing in their work. Why do i take issue with this? Simple why dont they just implement the model themselves (the model proposed is simple extension of linear modelling) within using any of the brillant probabistic programming langauges that exist and get their analysis done.

As such here, I would like to make the aruguement that this is a real world example of what Proffessor Richard McElreath describes as a first world modelling problem. Such that people can only work with pre canned packages to complete their anlaysis. I completely understand why this happens because such projects as CausalPy or any software for that matter is to automatise and reduce the workload away from end users. Of course when your faced with an analysis problem were no easy soltution exist within your preferred analysis package you become stuck. Of course, this is what probabilistic programing languages were invented for.

Ultimately, if you can't build your model yourself (within reason), you don't understand it. If you're not willing to try and fail (ask for help), you don't care to truly understand your analysis either.
